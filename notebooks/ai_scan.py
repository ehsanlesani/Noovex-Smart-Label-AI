    ðŸ“˜ Project Overview â€“ NOOVEX AI Labeling System

    This script is part of a broader AI-focused industrial R&D initiative, combining deep learning, image processing, and real-world deployment. It is inspired by
    practical scientific methodologies used in commercial and industrial systems, and shaped by the developerâ€™s extensive experience in large-scale business applications.
    
    The trained model is deployed on a secure server and integrated into the NOOVEX platform, enabling real-time label verification and product interaction
    for end-users via mobile devices.
    
    The core workflow includes:
    1. **Label Generation**: All product labels are uniquely generated and stored in structured datasets.
    2. **Model Training**: These labels are then fed into a deep learning model for supervised training and recognition.
    3. **Deployment**: Once the model is fully trained, the output is deployed on a secure server for real-time label verification and product interaction.
    
    The final system allows users to scan product labels via mobile devices and instantly verify authenticity, access product details, activate warranties, and more.
    
    This script includes data preprocessing, image rendering, hashing, PDF generation, and dataset management.
